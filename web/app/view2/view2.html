    <h2>Setting up the Project Architecture - Bancho</h2>
    <p>I was responsible for creating database tables for the logging-in and also changing the back-end log-in code to use those tables. For the password hashing, I found some code online which I use. I use the method PasswordHash.createHash(password) to generate a hash for the given password, using random salt. The return value is a string which contains a really long string. This string is made up of 3 parts, each separated by a semicolon. The first part is a number (1000 in our case), which indicates the iterations when it comes to the algorithm, used for the hashing. The second part is the salt value and the third one – the actual hash. Therefore, the value passwordHash which I store in the database contains both the salt for the password and the actual hash and can be used to successfully check the validity of the password.</p>
    <h2>OpenShift problem - Bancho</h2>
    <p>When uploading the war file to OpenShift, we encountered a problem which we had never seen before. Once the application was deployed and we tried to access the link, we would get a 404 not found (). We went through all the deployment steps again, but to no avail. Next, using PuTTy we accessed the server logs on OpenShift and discovered that the following exception is being thrown during server start-up:
ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.catalina.ha.ClusterRuleSet. We searched for a solution online, but once again, to no avail. (e.g. https://access.redhat.com/solutions/393213 – How is this a solution?!).</p>
    <h2>The Admin (All Users) Page</h2>
    <p>Firstly, I included the registerAPI giving users the ability to create new account right away.
 Secondly I helped for and did some features from the second question (mainly in the javascript file view3.js).
 Last but not least I added a new GET-REST service(api/admin/users) providing information
 as a JSON LIst about all the users in the system. This can be seen only by the Admin role
 Моreover, I have added the DELETE-REsT service(api/admin/users/:id) which deletes a user
 with the given id.
 In my opinion we worked together really successful, we were cooperative and every time we had a 
 problem we found the solution to it together.Looking at the work we all have done I can savely say 
 that we all learned a lot from this CA.</p>
